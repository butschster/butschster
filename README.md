I'm a highly experienced Senior PHP developer with over 15 years of development experience under my belt. I'm currently working at SpiralScout, where I'm building the open source Spiral Framework and diving into the [Spiral Framework](https://github.com/spiral), [Cycle ORM](https://github.com/cycle), [Temporalio](https://temporal.io/), and [RoadRunner](https://github.com/roadrunner-server).

My extensive experience and skills in PHP development allow me to quickly and effectively solve problems and deliver top-quality solutions. I have a strong background in Laravel, VueJS, TailwindCSS. 

In addition to my professional work, I am also an active contributor to open source. I contributed to projects such as [laravel/framework](https://github.com/laravel/framework), [nunomaduro/termwind](https://github.com/nunomaduro/termwind), [roadrunner-server/roadrunner](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner), e.t.c.

I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I love contributing to open source. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat or collaborate â€“ I'm always open to new connections and projects.
